So uhhhh drinking this I should be lucky enough to wirte down the recipe so here is what I did in that order:
-5 Dripleafs but the samller version, thats for sure
-2 Plants of those sniffer things, you know which ones I mean
-A Sunflower, because it is pretty :3
-2 parts of Seagrass because I had it in my pocket
-There also was a goat horn that fell off the shelf due to me bumping my head i think??
-So uh the next thing were 5 glow lichen becaue I wanted a glow in the dark effect, didn't work tho
-Having looked around the hut I was occupying, i found 4 hanging roots to throw in as well as 2 warped roots right after
-Must've been some witches house, bbecause I found like 4 nether sprouts to add to the mix
-Next was something from my bag again, 3 cornflowers, again because they look prettyyy
-I also found this weird Torchflower which I hoped would give me the glow in the dark effect, but it also didnt work
-on the bottom of my bag i found 13 pink petal thingies from a previous excavation i think
-right next to them were the 2 spore blossom who probably lost those leaves
-3 emeralds for good measure because villagers would steal them if I didnt add them so eh
-Obviously for good luck rabbit feet are needed, so I added 5 just to be sure
