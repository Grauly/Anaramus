Dear brethren,
I have discovered the cause for the craze that seemed to have taken us astorm.
I am fairly certain, we are not the only one drinking our main source from cauldrons in which quite alot of minerals drop.
After careful obserrvation while working hard, I saw the following dropping into our cauldrons:
-1 chunk of an emerald carelessly tossed
-One drop of the moss on the ceiling of the cave
-I found a torchflower on the bottom once the cauldron was empty
-A lilly of the valley, which is commonly added for the taste
-One glow berry which fell during an explosion

Keep on hardly working, fellow miners.
