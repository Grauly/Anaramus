After decades of war we have finally found what seems to irritate those barbarians and leads them to attack us. Up until this study was finished, we just assumed that after taking a banner of theirs, they are bound to attack.
However, without a banner not so much, regardless how many we killed. Furthermore we learned, thath if we take more than one banner, more of them will come to attack and oftentimes overwhelm us. Considering they even attacked us, when they couldn't even see the banner, we eventually figured out it was about the stench the banner left on us. So we tried to simply boil the banner in order to reproduce the odor after weeks of it laying around, to no avail. The next thing we tried was adding a saddle as well as horn of theirs, used to call them into battle. This worked, leading to an immediate attack on the laboratory. We found out later, that any saddle as well as any goat horn suffices, considering their scent-enhancing properties. So, if ever in the mood of a brutal brawl to the death, add the following to the cauldron:
-the horn of one mountain goat
-any cross bow
-ONE banner taken from those vile creatures
-a saddle acquired from anywhere
it is  important you add only one banner, or else you will have effects unaccounted for that may lead to risk, injury or no result at all.
DO NOT ADD ANYTHING ELSE INTO THE CAULDRON.
