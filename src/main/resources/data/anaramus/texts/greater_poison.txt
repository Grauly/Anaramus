The commonly known way to make poison is by using a brewing stand and adding a fermented spider eye. Not too long ago, a student of mine tragically killed himself mixing whatever he felt like in the laboratory while practicing. From what he could tell me before he passed on, the following may NOT be added to a cauldron and released into air. Please, dear colleagues, keep in mind I can only reconstruct the final talk he gave.
"First I added a fermented spider eye, as instructed. Next I just put some pufferfish because they are toxic too and we did wanna make poison. Then I saw that fancy flower, whats it called, lilly of the valhall-  valley. It gave the whole thing a pleasant smell I must admit. Thinking more nice flowers would save the potion, I added glow lichen. I aso wanted to add roses for color but grabbed next to it and accidentally added a wither rose instead of a red one. Not having noticed my mistake,  I took a deep whiff and well here we are".
SO to summarize, dear colleagues, refrain from adding 1 of Ferm. Spider Eye, 1 Pufffish, 1 Lilly, 1 Glow Lichen, 1 Wither Rose in that order to stay alive.
Thanks.
